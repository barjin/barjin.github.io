# Competition Analysis - Declarative Web Automation Framework

Since the web automation industry is growing at a rapid rate, it is crucial to match the competition. 
The following text offers a comparison of available competing products with the proposed project on various qualities. 

The comparison is made on the following points:
- **Ease of use** - The project should allow the user to create web automations using a comprehensive UI.
- **Workflow resilience** - The workflow format allows to define conditions for certain actions, letting the interpreter to choose based on the current state. This helps to mitigate runtime exceptions from getting into an unexpected state, caused e.g. by an A/B test experiment).
- **Open format** - The definition of the format is open and allows for simple third-party application development.
